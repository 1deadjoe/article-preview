## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned the use of javascript's event listeners, effectively utilizing them

### Continued development

I am yet to get a grasp of the position attribute of HTMl.
I am yet to learn how to position the share links above the button. The one thing I haven't gotten around.

### Useful resources

- [Google Developer Website ](https://www.web.dev) - This helped me learn how to use event listeners to changeclasses of HTML elements easily.
